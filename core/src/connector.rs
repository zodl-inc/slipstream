//! Lightwalletd connection factory honoring the old SDK's per-call Tor policy.
//!
//! Mirrors the old SDK's `ServiceMode`: the **bulk** block fetch is ALWAYS direct (the old
//! SDK's `blockStream` uses `.direct` — public range data, too high-volume for Tor; per-user
//! exposure (IP + birthday) is identical with or without Tor). Wallet-**identifying** metadata
//! (treestate, latest-block, lightd info) goes over **isolated Tor circuits** when Tor is on.
//!
//! Tor is transport-only — the bytes written to the wallet DB are identical either way, so the
//! golden + darkside oracles are unaffected.
//!
//! Runtime model (T-Tor.0, GO): the engine OWNS its arti [`TorConn`], bootstrapped on the
//! engine's own tokio runtime (`Client::create` binds to `PreferredRuntime::current()`), so no
//! `block_on` and no cross-runtime polling — see `tests/tor_runtime_spike.rs`.
