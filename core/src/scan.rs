//! Scan driver: consumes ordered chunks, runs upstream scan_cached_blocks once
//! per chunk (bounded memory: one commit per chunk), and hides the per-chunk
//! treestate RPC by prefetching the NEXT boundary state while the current
//! chunk scans (spike T2.3 outcome: ChainState must come from the server;
//! prefetch makes its latency invisible).
//!
//! v0.5 REVISION of the T2.3 premise (2026-07-06 pacer plan): the P1 split
//! measured the prefetch overhang at 62 % of the Mac scan wall — the RTT was
//! NOT invisible, and the ChainState does NOT have to come from the server:
//! `local_treestate` seeds one ChainState per range and absorbs the scanned
//! blocks' own commitments into running frontiers (`treestate.rs`), serving
//! every later boundary locally; the sampled server fetch survives as an
//! OFF-path audit.
//!
//! T5.2 — Adaptive sub-batching (opt-in as of T5.5): pass
//! `batch_target_ms = Some(ms)` to split each chunk into time-targeted
//! sub-batches (~ms each).  Default `None` = one scan call per chunk
//! (pre-T5.2 behaviour; fastest on all hardware).

/// scan_cached_blocks requires `from_state.height + 1 == from_height` (upstream

/// the existing chunk-boundary prefetch: for every sub-batch we spawn a prefetch
/// for its *end* height *before* running the blocking scan; we await the prefetch
/// result after the scan completes and use it as `from_state` for the next
/// sub-batch.  The chunk-boundary case is the degenerate case where one sub-batch
/// equals the whole chunk.
///
/// RPC cost: ~1 GetTreeState per ~TARGET_BATCH_MS on slow devices, fully hidden
/// behind the blocking scan; zero extra RPCs on fast devices (fast-path = 1 call
/// per chunk, same as before T5.2).

/// Like [`scan_chunks`] but uses a provided initial `TreeState` instead of fetching
/// one from the server. For subsequent chunk boundaries (prefetches), an empty tree state
/// at the chunk-end height is synthesized — this is correct for fabricated/empty blocks
/// (no shielded outputs → tree doesn't change between chunks).
///
/// **USE ONLY IN TESTS** against darkside servers that do not support GetTreeState
/// (e.g. lightwalletd v0.4.9). Production code uses [`scan_chunks`].
///
/// The correctness assertion this enables:
///   `scan_cached_blocks` will still decrypt and record shielded notes for blocks that
///   contain them — the provided initial state is used as the frontier before the range;
///   the scanner updates the frontier as it processes each block.
///
/// ## No sub-batching here (T5.2)
///
/// Synthesized tree states cannot be split mid-chunk: the synthesized state at
/// chunk_end holds a frozen copy of the tree that was valid *before* this chunk was
/// scanned.  Splitting into sub-batches would require a real server treestate at
/// each intra-chunk boundary, which is unavailable in darkside/test contexts.
/// Sub-batching is therefore applied only in the production [`scan_chunks`] path.
///
/// `sparse` — when `true`, use the `SparseFacade` / in-memory shardtree path
/// (exactly as `scan_chunks` does); one `SparseTreeState` is created for the
/// whole call, matching the one-per-range contract. Added at T6.4 so the
/// darkside oracle test can exercise the same sparse code-path as production.
///
/// `write_behind` — when `true` (requires `sparse`), use the T6.9 depth-1
/// write-behind pipeline exactly as production `scan_chunks` does: pending-aware
/// `WriteBehindFacade` + `PersistLane` (second connection to the session's DB
/// file), submit-after-scan, full drain barrier at exit. Added at T6.9 so the
/// darkside variants can exercise the write-behind path against real fixtures.
///
/// `gpu_subtree` — when `true` (requires `sparse`), route the Orchard subtree
/// build to the GPU (feature `gpu`) exactly as production does, mirroring
/// `EngineConfig::gpu_subtree`. Added at B0.4 so the darkside oracle can prove
/// the GPU subtree build yields a byte-identical data.db against real fixtures.
/// `graft` — v0.4 Plan A: run this range with the graft accumulator enabled
/// (the byte-equal and semantic oracles A/B this flag against real fixtures).
