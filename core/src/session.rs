//! Engine-owned sync **session orchestration** — the full sync lifecycle around the
//! per-pass engine (`engine::sync_once`).
//!
//! This is the single entry point a host calls to run a complete, privacy-correct sync:
//! resilient Tor bootstrap → resilient initial pass (T8.7) → tip-following loop with mempool
//! monitoring. It encodes the privacy + resilience POLICY (jitter-vs-fingerprint, never fall
//! back to direct on Tor failure, isolated circuits for metadata, never surface a transient
//! error to a foreground wallet, mempool-non-fatal) so that EVERY host (iOS/Android FFI, CLI,
//! zingo, zallet) gets it right by calling one function instead of re-deriving the loop.
//!
//! Lifted verbatim from the FFI `sync_body` (rust/src/lib.rs) — behaviour is unchanged; only
//! the location moved (into the crate that already owns the state/event/handle types).
