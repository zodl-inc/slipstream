//! [API v2.1 E-6] `restore_anchor` — engine-owned wallet-provisioning anchor.
//!
//! Hosts creating or restoring a wallet need two chain facts before the first sync pass:
//!   - RESTORE: the `recover_until` height (the current tip), so the [birthday..tip]
//!     backfill is tracked as recovery (`is_recovering`) — with the OFFLINE fallback
//!     policy inside: a NULL recover_until would make a restore look like a new wallet
//!     (no "Restoring" UI, no recovery gate — field failure syncLogsMac9), so an
//!     unreachable server falls back to `max(bundled-checkpoint height, birthday + 1)`.
//!   - NEW: a reorg-safe recent tree state (`tip − MAX_REORG` floored at Sapling
//!     activation), so funds sent to the brand-new wallet can't be missed if the tip
//!     reorganizes; offline ⇒ no anchor (the host keeps its bundled checkpoint).
//!
//! This POLICY used to live per host (the Swift SDK's `Initializer.initialize` +
//! `importAccount`); moving it here gives every host the same provisioning semantics
//! through one primitive. Keys never cross this boundary — the host keeps its
//! `createAccount`/`importAccount` calls and passes only heights.
//!
//! Privacy: the tree-state/height fetches are identifying (they reveal wallet-birthday
//! interest), so when the host runs Tor they ride an isolated circuit (`MetadataUnique`)
//! exactly like the sync pass's metadata calls. A requested-but-failed Tor bootstrap is
//! treated as OFFLINE (fallback policy) — never a silent de-anonymising direct retry.
