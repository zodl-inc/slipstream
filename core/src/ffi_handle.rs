//! Opaque FFI handle for the Slipstream engine.
//!
//! Lifecycle:
//!   open  → allocates SlipstreamHandle (tokio runtime + snapshot atomics + event ring)
//!   start → spawns sync task on the runtime; previous task cancelled first
//!   stop  → cancels the sync task; handle stays live for snapshot/drain_events
//!   free  → drops the handle (drops runtime → all tasks cancel)
//!
//! All fields are Send + Sync; the handle is always behind a raw pointer (Box::into_raw),
//! accessed from Swift/Obj-C single-threaded callers serialised by the actor.
//!
//! BINDING: SlipstreamHandle is NOT exposed in the C header (opaque pointer). Its fields
//! are internal. The C header only sees `typedef struct SlipstreamHandle SlipstreamHandle;`.
